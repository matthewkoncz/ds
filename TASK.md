# Task description

Implement a simple website with two subpages: user profile and user information form.
Website must contain:

- header with logo
- simple menu with navigation
- content
- footer (optional - can be just a simple placeholder with paragraph of lorem ipsum to demonstrate responsiveness)

Form should contain the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone
- Birthday - About
- Avatar

Once the form is submitted, the content should change to profile view with data from the form. This view should contain:

- Same page header, menu and footer (SPA)
- Space for profile img
- Data completed in the form on the previous page should be displayed in separate lines.

Website:

- Should be responsive.
- Should be SPA
- Use semantic HTML where applicable
- The form should be validated
- Submitted data should be session persistent
- Should look good and be comfortable to use and understand (UX will be evaluated)

Please attach a text file (in English) with comments to the implementation:

- what assumptions did you make,
- why did you decide to use specific techniques,
- what could be the alternative solutions,
- any other comments you think we should know when assessing your solution.

Bonus points for:

- Hosting project repository on any Git hosting services (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.)
- Design application in a way that it would be easy to connect to existing API for storing data in a real backend. - Image optimisation for responsive layout
- Image size/type restriction
- Deploy Application to any hosting service to make it available online

Note:
the styling should be done by yourself (without the use of libraries)
