# My comments for the project

## What were my assumptions

The interviewers want to see:

- my UI/UX design skills
- my experience with a frontend framework
- my coding skills
- my coding style
- my experience with responsiveness
- my styling skills without using a UI component library
- my ability to work independently
- my ideas for the not specified parts of the task
- my experience with version control systems (git)
- my experience in interacting with a backend system
- my DevOps experience (hosting)

## Technologies

### Frontend framework

Using one of the popular frontend frameworks/libraries makes our work faster at creating a single page application.
I selected Angular for frontend framework. I have experience with Angular, React and a very little with Vue.js, but in the last year I used Angular, therefore I decided to use this one in my project.

### Programming language

Angular supports ES5, ES6, Dart and TypeScript. I like using TypeScript over JavaScript in case of an Angular application because it provides a safer and cleaner coding environment. Also the most documentation and community support is available for this language. Therefore I chose TS.

### Styling

The only CSS preprocessor I have used is SASS. I use this technology because of its advantages like:

- cleaner code
- quicker coding
- nested syntax
- variables

### Version control

I used GIT for version control because it is free and I know this technology the best. I published the project on GitHub because of the same reasons.

### Hosting

GitHub provides GitHub Pages which can be used for free hosting. I already owned a domain name (koncz.dev), so I used that for the project.

### Session persistent storage

I used the browser's local storage for storing the data. The HTTP communication is also solved with a free mock service.

### Routing

Routing is solved by the default Angular routing module.

### IDE

I used VSCode (macOS).

### TESTING

I wrote some unit tests but the code is not totally covered. I used the default Karma and Jasmine framworks.

## What were the challenging parts

The UI design is not my best talent, but I would like to develop in this area as well.

## What I learned

Saving images to LocalStorage was completely new for me. I also gained experience with techniques that I use rarely (reactive forms, file upload, optimizing images for responsive layouts, semantic HTML).

## Alternative solutions

- use SSR for SEO reasons (if needed)
- navigation bar on the left/right side of the page
- use other language/libraries/frameworks
- build UI with a UI component library (PrimeFaces, Bootstrap, Material)

## Extra things that I added

- Welcome page
- GitHub tickets

## What I missed

I had not as much time for the project as I wanted, but there are some things that I wanted to add to the project.

E.g:

- Accessibility features (for visually impared users)
- Sources page to list the used free resources (images)
- Localization
- Integration tests
- More links for the footer

## Feedback

It was an interesting task and it highlighed some technologies/techniques for me that I could improve at.

Thank you for giving me a chance and reviewing my work. Please give me a feedback, it can be very useful for my future improvement. :)
